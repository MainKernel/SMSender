##### Install ADB on Your Computer

In my case I am using Arch with pacman package manager for me the installation command is:

    `sudo pacman -Sy android-tools`

This package contains adb

##### Connect Your Phone via USB

    Use a USB cable to connect your phone to the computer.

    On your phone, when prompted, allow USB debugging (check "Always allow" if desired).

##### Verify the Connection

   1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
   2. Run
    `adb devices`

* If your device appears (e.g., ABCDEF123456 device), itâ€™s connected.
